# basic-siem
 A basic Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system built to learn about log analysis and security monitoring.
 
Project Purpose (üå±):
 This project is a hands-on exploration of how SIEM systems work under the hood. Modern SIEMS are not responsible for an IT environment on their own and have ML and AI integrations. My SIEM will have the basics implemented with potential for future extensions.

Tech Stack (üõ†Ô∏è):

 BackEnd: FastAPI (Python)
 
 Data Processing: Apache Kafka with a Python parser and Logstash for syslog/JSON.
 
 Storage: Elasticsearch for logs and PostgreSQL for metadata/config.
 
 Frontend: React.
 
 Visualization: Grafana.










Disclaimer:
This is a learning project - not intended for production use. Built to understand SIEM concepts and modern data processing architectures.
